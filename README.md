# Flutter Click Counter Backed By Firebase

We created this Flutter project during our SE 380 Mobile Application Development course. 

This is the default click counter Flutter app, modified to keep the number of clicks on Firebase. 

We used a couple of different techniques related to asynchronous programming. Please check the commits to see different versions of the app as it evolved.
